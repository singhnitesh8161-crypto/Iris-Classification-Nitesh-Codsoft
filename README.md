🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses the classic Iris dataset to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

📌 Objective

The goal is to build a supervised machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on four features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

🌼 Dataset Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with the following structure:

Feature	Description
sepal length	in cm
sepal width	in cm
petal length	in cm
petal width	in cm
species	Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualized feature distributions using histograms and boxplots

Explored relationships using pair plots and correlation heatmaps

Identified clear separability between species based on petal measurements
